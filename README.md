# str-chess
A chess game where Simultaneous Turn Resolution is employed. This chess variant involves two distinct phases: the *Command Phase* and the *Execution Phase*. In the *Command Phase*, both players issue a move simultaneously. Once both are done giving orders, the game goes into the *Execution Phase* where both moves are executed simultaneously.
